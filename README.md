# scTransient Sample Notebooks

The paper describing scTransient includes analyses of dataset that are outside the scope of files to be kept with the repository.

## Files
**sctransient_ineuron.ipynb** : Analysis of the induced neuron datasets to show how high-scoring genes were detected using the Transient Event Score.

## Directories
**method_evaluations** : The paper describes a comparison between scTransient, tradeSeq, and GPFates using synthetic datasets. The thousands of experiments can require hours of processing time for tradeSeq and GPFates, so parallel execution at scale is necessary. The directory contains all the materials necessary to obtain those results.
